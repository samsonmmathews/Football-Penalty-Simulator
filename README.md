## 🃎 Overview

The **Football Penalty Simulator** allows users to simulate a penalty kick scenario:

* Shoot the ball **left** or **right**.
* The goalkeeper dives randomly to either side.
* If the ball goes opposite to the goalkeeper, it's a **Goal!**
* If the ball goes the same way, the shot is **Saved!**

The project demonstrates **CSS animations**, **DOM manipulation**, and interactive **game logic** using JavaScript.
